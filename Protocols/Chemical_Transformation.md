PROTOCOL NAME: Chemical Transformation

ESTIMATED EXECUTION TIME: 2 hours 

ESTIMATED ACTIVE TIME: 30 min

ESTIMATED IDLE TIME: 1 hour 30 min

DESCRIPTION: This method involves the use of competent bacterial cells, typically treated with calcium chloride, which makes their cell membranes more permeable. The competent cells are then exposed to the new DNA, often in the form of plasmids, and subjected to a heat shock, which facilitates the uptake of the DNA into the bacterial cells. Once inside, the new DNA can be expressed, allowing the bacteria to acquire new genetic traits. This technique is widely used in molecular biology for cloning, gene expression studies, and the production of recombinant proteins

EQUIPMENTS:

Ice bucket \
Bunsen burner \
Pipette p20 \
Water bath at 42&deg;C \
Incubator 37&deg;C \
Orbital shaker incubator 37&deg;C & 250 rpm

MATERIALS: 

Ice \

LB broth \
LB agar plates

STEPS:

1. - [ ] Defrost 50 uL of chemically competent cells (one tube).
2. - [ ] Add 1 uL of extracted plasmid DNA or 5 uL for assemblies.
3. - [ ] Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
4. - [ ] Heat shock at 42&deg;C for 1 minute.
5. - [ ] Incubate on ice for 2 minutes.
6. - [ ] Add 200 uL of LB broth.
7. - [ ] Incubate at 37&deg;C with shaking at 250 rpm
8. - [ ] Plate out on a LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
9. - [ ] Incubate overnight at 37&deg;C
