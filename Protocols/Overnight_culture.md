PROTOCOL NAME: Overnight Culture

ESTIMATED EXECUTION TIME: ~17 hour \
ESTIMATED ACTIVE TIME: >15 min\
ESTIMATED IDLE TIME: ~17 hour \
DESCRIPTION: Overnight culture is a protocol used to grow bacteria, since it takes around 16 hours for bacteria to reach exponential growth phase it is usually done overnight. 

EQUIPMENTS:

Bunsen burner \
Orbital shaker incubator 

MATERIALS: 

LB Broth \
50 mL centrifuge tube (a.k.a. Falcon tube) 

STEPS:

1. - [ ] Thaw antibiotics on ice or metal beads.
2. - [ ] Clean the bench with ethanol, let it evaporate and turn on the bunsen burner.
3. - [ ] Pour 5 mL of LB broth in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
4. - [ ] Add 1 uL of the proper antibiotic per 1 mL of LB broth.
5. - [ ] Pick a bacteria colony or stock by touching the bacteria source with a pipette or combi loop.
6. - [ ] Inoculate the LB broth in the 50 mL centrifuge tube with bacteria by placing the pipette tip or combi loop on it.
7. - [ ] Close the 50 mL centrifuge tube leaving some space for air.
8. - [ ] Place the 50 mL centrifuge tube into the orbital shaker incubator at 250 rpm and 37 Celcius degrees.
9. - [ ] Incubate the bacterial culture for ~16 hours.
